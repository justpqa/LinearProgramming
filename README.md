# LinearProgramming
A simple program for getting LP problems from user and solve it using simplex algorithm and interior point. I did this as a challenge to myself on implementing one of my favorite algorithm in mathematical modeling area without using any libraries such as Pandas and Numpy. I am looking forward to improve it for more functionality (and maybe try to implement it on different languages like C++, as I am learning it, or implement more complex one, like the interior point as I implement). My goal is try to implement until the most recent and optimized algorithm until now

P/s: Latest update, I wrote my own method for matrix (just a small and weird? challenge) and for each type of solver, I make its own matrix form.
