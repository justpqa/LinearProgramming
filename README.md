# LinearProgramming
A simple program for getting LP problems from user and solve it using simplex algorithm and interior point. I did this as a challenge to myself on implementing one of my favorite algorithm in mathematical modeling area without using any libraries such as Pandas and Numpy. I am looking forward to improve it for more functionality (and maybe try to implement it on different languages like C++, as I am learning it, or implement more complex one, like the interior point as I implement). My goal is try to implement until the most recent and optimized algorithm until now

P/s: in the case of interior point method, as we need to do many matrix operation, currently I need to use Numpy in order to perform the algorithm
