# SimplexAlg
A simple program for getting LP problems from user and solve it using simplex algorithm. I did this as a challenge to myself on implementing one of my favorite algorithm in mathematical modeling area without using any libraries such as Pandas and Numpy. I am looking forward to improve it for more functionality (and maybe try to implement it on different languages like C++, as I am learning it). 

Feel free to look at my code and give suggestions on what I should do to improve this. Thank you and have fun!

P/s: this one currently does not support big M method or two phase simplex, but I will try to implement them later
